For Ansible to communicate to a Windows host and use Windows modules, the Windows host must meet these base requirements for connectivity:
With Ansible you can generally manage Windows versions under the current and extended support from Microsoft. You can also manage desktop OSs including Windows 10 and 11, and server OSs including Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022.
You need to install PowerShell 5.1 or newer and at least .NET 4.0 on the Windows host.
You need to create and activate a WinRM listener. More details, see WinRM Listener.
To view the current listeners that are running on the WinRM service:
winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener                                     $PS Command
Now Install Openssh
open commandline and run following commands
winrm quickconfig
net start winrm
winrm set winrm/config/service/auth @{Basic="true"}
winrm set winrm/config/service @{AllowUnencrypted="true"}
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="WinRM" dir=in localport=5985 protocol=TCP action=allow
Restart-Service WinRM


Now create a inventoryfile
vim host.ini
[Windows]
host1 ansible_host=10.2.28.220 ansible_user=Administrator ansible_password=Bayer@5678

[all_servers:children]
Windows

[all_servers:vars]
ansible_port=5985
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
:wq

Now test using ping module:
ansible Windows -m win_ping -i win.ini
