For Ansible to communicate to a Windows host and use Windows modules, the Windows host must meet these base requirements for connectivity:
With Ansible you can generally manage Windows versions under the current and extended support from Microsoft. You can also manage desktop OSs including Windows 10 and 11, and server OSs including Windows Server 2016, 2019, and 2022.
You need to install PowerShell 5.1 or newer and at least .NET 4.0 on the Windows host.
You need to create and activate a WinRM listener. More details, see WinRM Listener.
To view the current listeners that are running on the WinRM service:
winrm enumerate winrm/config/Listener                                     $PS Command
Now Install Openssh
